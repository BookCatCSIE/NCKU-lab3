size=1000
sort(): 0.000246 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 0.008589 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size=10000
sort(): 0.002847 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 0.831074 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size=100000
sort(): 0.032167 seconds
v1/v2 are different.
insertion_sort(): 82.9196 seconds
v1/v2 are the same.

size=1000000
sort(): 0.377425 seconds
v1/v2 are different.

time-complexity of sort = O(n*log(n))
time-complexity of insertion-sort = O(n^2)
so the time to execute insertion-sort is longer than the time to execute sort.
